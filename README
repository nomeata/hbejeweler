hbejeweler
==========

This is an entry for the programming competition called for
by the Freies Magazin at http://www.freiesmagazin.de/programmierwettbewerb
by Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>. The code is
licenced under the terms of the GPL, version two or later.

It is implemented in Haskell and uses the game-tree library
from Colin Adams. It is bundled with the library for your
convenience.

To build the program, run the build.sh script. It requires
an installation of the ghc6 Haskell compiler. This generates
the binary “hbejeweler”.
